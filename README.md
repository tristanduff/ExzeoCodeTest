# ExzeoCodeTest
Final Push for Project Submission - Last Edited 15 Aug 2016

Live Site: http://exzeo-code-test-duff.herokuapp.com/

This project is being submitted as the Code Test for a prospective job with Exzeo. All files and supporting documentation are the creation of Tristan Duff, unless otherwise noted. The goal of the project is to fetch the current iTunes Top 100 albums listing and display it for the user in a smooth, responsive environment that reacts well to both desktop and mobile applications.
